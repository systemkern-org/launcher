Launcher
================
Launcher is a template for Web technology based Applications.
Based on Spring Boot it offers a specialised opinionated view on
how to modularise, implement and deploy such applications.

It is to be used and applied on an 'as is' basis with no guarantee of functionality.

The Goal
----------------
Even tough each project is different is different in a business sense,
there are still a lot of functionalities which overlap even between very
heterogeneous projects. Launcher aims to identify those overlaps and provide
dvelopers with a quickstart template.

This application template represents a strong opinionated view on the layout of Kotlin applications.
The layout is aimed at building a a _modularised monolith_ , which can easily be separated into
micro services at any point in time.

Application
================

### Application Configuration
Application configuration is done via standard spring-boot config providers
* application.properties is used for technical configuration
* application.yml can be used for business configuration

### Logging Configuration
Logging is done via the [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html) framework.
Logging configuration currently is only availible at compile time.

### Assembly and Distribution
For distribution of the assembled zip file via ftp call:
`mvn clean package wagon:upload-single`

### Distribution configuration
Ftp login credentials need to be configured in you maven settings xml.
Usually be found at ~/.m2/settings.xml

A custom settings file can also be generated by a shell command.
See bitbucket-pipelines.yml for an example

```
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>launcher-ftp-distribution-server</id>
      <username>myuseraccount</username>
      <password>s3cret</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```
