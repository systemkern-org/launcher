# Launcher #
Launcher is a template for Web technology based Applications.
Based on Spring Boot it offers a specialised opinionated view on
how to modularise, implement and deploy such applications.

It is to be used and applied on an 'as is' basis with no guarantee of functionality.

### The Idea
Even tough each project is different is different in a business sense,
there are still a lot of functionalities which overlap even between very
heterogeneous projects. Launcher aims to identify those overlaps and provide
dvelopers with a quickstart template.

This application template represents a strong opinionated view on the layout of Kotlin applications.
The layout is aimed at building a a _modularised monolith_ , which can easily be separated into
micro services at any point in time.

### What is provided by this Template
* runtime for local execution including 
  * application configuration
  * logging configuration
* build and distribution configurations
  * bitbucket pipelines (bitbucket-pipelines.yml)
  * travis ci (github) .travis.yml
  * assembly of distributable as zip
  * via ftp (see ./pom.xml)
  * cli runtime for windows and linux
  * google app engine runtime
* integration testing of the REST api
* documentation generation with SpringRestDocs through the integratoin tests
* Template for a customer readme.html


# Application #

### Application Configuration
Application configuration is done via standard spring-boot config providers
* application.properties is used for technical configuration
* application.yml can be used for business configuration

### Logging Configuration
Logging is done via the [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html) framework.
Logging configuration currently is only availible at compile time.

### Assembly and Distribution
For distribution of the assembled zip file via ftp call:
`mvn clean package wagon:upload-single`

### Distribution configuration
Ftp login credentials need to be configured in you maven settings xml.
Usually be found at ~/.m2/settings.xml

A custom settings file can also be generated by a shell command.
See bitbucket-pipelines.yml for an example

```
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>launcher-ftp-distribution-server</id>
      <username>myuseraccount</username>
      <password>s3cret</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```
